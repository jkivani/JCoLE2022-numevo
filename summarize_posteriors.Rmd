Load all posteriors:

```{r}
require(rstan)
require(bayesplot)

x <- NULL

for (i in 1:7) {
  load(paste('rates_ratio_',i,'.Rdata'))
  x <- cbind(x,extract(fit.full)$ratio)
}

colnames(x) <- colnames(ST.data)
```

Histograms showing posterior gain/loss ratios for each feature:

```{r}
mcmc_hist(x) + vline_at(1)
```

For each feature, what proportion of the posterior gain/loss ratios are greater than one (indicating long-term preference)?

```{r}
apply(x,2,function(x){length(which(x>1))/length(x)})
```

Multiple exponence and phrules are strongly dispreferred; there is strong evidence that fixed_position is preferred (in > 90% of samples), and decisive evidence that the remaining features are preferred.
